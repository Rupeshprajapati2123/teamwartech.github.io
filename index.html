    <p class="p1"> 1.	<b>Gryffindor</b> is one of the four Houses. Gryffindor instructed the Sorting<br> Hat to choose students possessing characteristics he most valued, such<br> as courage, chivalry, and determination, to be sorted into his house. The<br> emblematic animal is a lion, and its colours are scarlet and gold. The<br> Gryffindor house emphasises the traits of courage as well as “daring,<br> nerve, and chivalry” , and thus its members are generally regarded<br> as brave, though sometimes to the point of recklessness.</p>

<p class="p1"> 2.	<b>Hufflepuff</b> is the most inclusive among the four houses; valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members. Students belonging to this house are known to be hard-working, friendly, loyal, honest and rather impartial. It may be that due to their values, Hufflepuffs are not as competitive as the other houses, and are more modest about their accomplishments.

<p class="p1"> 4. 	<b>Slytherin</b> In establishing the house, Salazar instructed the Sorting Hat to pick students who had a few particular characteristics he most valued. Those characteristics include cunning, resourcefulness, leadership, and ambition. Slytherins tend to be ambitious, shrewd, cunning, strong leaders, and achievement-oriented. They also have highly developed senses of self-preservation. This means that Slytherins tend to hesitate before acting, so as to weigh all possible outcomes before deciding exactly what should be done.</p>
