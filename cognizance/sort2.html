    <p class="para">
        As it’s rightly said,<br>
        “Two heads are better then one”<br>
        So, pack your bags to embark on the scintillating journey of teamwork,<br>
        Where you rise together, learn together and have fun together.<br>
        On the very first day of the fest, you all shall get segregated into the four coneted houses Hogwarts,<br> 
        each one mind boggling in it’s own unique way (Gryffindor,Syltherin,Hupplepuff,Ravenclaw).There<br>
         should be a “Sorting Hat Ceremony” where a lucky draw shall fetch you your house and identity for the<br>
          next 2 days of the enchanting fest!<br>
          Best of luck! :)
